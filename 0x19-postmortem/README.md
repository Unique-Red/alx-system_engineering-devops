## Issue Summary
My major issue was with the webserver and installation of the mysql db in my servers. Aside from that, I had a series of issues with “SSHing” into my servers. The time frame is not exactly what I can't exactly remember but I had issues with it all through the day.
Well, I happen to be the only user that was affected. The root cause of the issue was my public key and the sandbox.
## Attempted Solution
Issue was detected in the early hours of the day  and I tried to solve the problem by checking up different resources outside what ALX shared.I took the wrong paths of trying other linux variants until I ended up with ubuntu again. Getting back to an ubuntu related document resolved the issue.
